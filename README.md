* high level interface to CasADi
* NLP modeling/solving (examples/Basic.hs, examples/BasicJ.hs)
* monadic NLP modeling DSL (examples/StaticExample.hs)
* OCP modeling/solving (examles/Glider.hs)
* monadic OCP modeling DSL (examples/OcpM.hs, examples/Rocket.hs)
* live plotter for OCP solving (examples/Plotter.hs)
